Information on API:

Uses button api for calls to remove transactions, add tansactions,
update prices, get buttons, etc. (Basically everything)
All API calls are in click.js
Supported API calls:

/getButtons: Gets buttons from till_buttons table
/clickButton: updates the current_transaction table to reflect the item clicked to be added
/removeItem: updates the current_transaction table to reflect the item clicked to be removed
/totalAmount: Gets the total cost of all items in current_transaction
/getPrices: Gets the prices of the items in the current_transaction table
/getTrans: Gets the current_transaction table
/getUsers: Gets the users from the users table
/void: Voids the current_transaction AKA truncates the current_transaction table in the database
/makeSale: Truncates the current_transaction table and copies its contents into the transaction_archive
/ticketize: Creates a receipt from the current_transaction table before it gets truncated

Login and logout functionality are handled on the client side so the only API related to that functionality is getUsers
When we make a sale we call ticketize, which saves the current_transaction data on the client side as a ticket,
then call make sale which truncates the data in current_transaction and sends it to the archive table.
